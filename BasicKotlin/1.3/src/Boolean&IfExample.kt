/* Challenge :
* Check if the user data for registering an account is valid. Data is valid if:
*
* 1. Properties are not empty.
* 2. Username has at least 6 characters.
* 3. Password has at least 10 characters.
* 4. The email contains a '@' and a â€˜.`.
*
* Hint: use the `contains()` function on a String.
*
* Use `if` as an expression, to assign a respective error message if any of the cases fail! Then print it out.
*
* The appropriate String messages are:
* 1. All values are empty -> "You must fill in your data!"
* 2. Username is too short -> "Username needs to be at least 6 characters long!"
* 3. Password is too short -> "Password needs to be at least 10 characters long!"
* 4. Email doesn't contain a '@' or a '.' -> "Invalid email format."
* 5. Every field is valid -> "Successful registration!"
*
* Print out the respective message!
