/*
Challenge 1:
  - Create an interface `Shape` that defines a property `area` of type Double.
  - Implement `Shape` with classes representing Square, Triangle, and Circle.
  - Add a circle, a square, and a triangle to an array.
  - Convert the array of shapes to an array of areas using map.

 **HINTS**
 - The area of a square = one of its sides squared
 - The area of a triangle = 0.5 multiplied by its base multiplied by its height
 - The area of a circle = pi multiplied by its radius squared
