    * Challenge:
    * - Create a list of strings, describing items on your table. If some items appear more than once, add them multiple
    * times to the list. E.g. you have two pens or four pieces of paper.
    *
    * - Turn that list into a set, using the `list.toSet()` function, and check if the duplicate items appear.
    * - Remove an item you don't really need on your desk, e.g. car keys.
    * - Iterate over the items, and print them out.
