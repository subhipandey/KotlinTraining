### BASIC Functions

Write a function named `printFullName` that takes two strings called `firstName` and `lastName`.
The function should print out the full name defined as `firstName` + " " + `lastName`.
Use it to print out your own full name using the parameter names.

 Use the printFullName function without any parameter names.

 Create `calculateFullNameWithLength` to return a pair containing both the full name and the
